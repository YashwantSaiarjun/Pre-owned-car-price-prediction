Predicting the price of pre owned cars using machine learning and python

## Objective:
Using the existing dataset of the price of pre owned cars, we are the predicting the price of a used car of our needs. Using machine learning we predict the price by considering the existing factors of the car like 'seller', 'offerType', 'price', 'abtest', 'vehicleType', 'gearbox', 'powerPS', 'model', 'kilometer', 'fuelType', 'brand', 'notRepairedDamage', 'postalCode' and 'Age'. 

## Languages used:
Python

## Required libraries: 
pandas,numpy,seaborn

## Machine Learning model used: Linear Regression

### Accuracy of the model: 78.10850406670798 %
